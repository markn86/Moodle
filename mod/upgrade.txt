This files describes API changes in /mod/* - activity modules,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.3 ===

* External functions that were returning file information now return the following additional file fields:
  - mimetype (the file mime type)
  - isexternalfile (if is a file reference to a external repository)
  - repositorytype (the repository name in case is a external file)
  Those fields are VALUE_OPTIONAL for backwards compatibility.
* The issue MDL-55611 introduced 3 new callbacks for each module.
  - mod_xyz_core_calendar_is_event_visible(calendar_event $event): This callback determines if an event should be visible
    throughout the site. For example, the assignment module creates a grading event for teachers. We do not want this
    event being visible to users who can not perform this action (eg. students), so we return false for those users.
    If you do not implement this function then the event will always be visible.
  - mod_xyz_core_calendar_core_calendar_provide_event_action(calendar_event $event, \core_calendar\action_factory $factory):
    This function takes a calendar event and provides the action associated with it, or null if there is none (in which
    case the event will not be shown). This is used by the new block_myoverview plugin. If you do not implement this
    function then the events created by your plugin will never be shown on the block.

    Eg.
        return $factory->create_instance(
            $name,
            $url,
            $itemcount,
            $actionable
        );

       $name String The name of the event, eg. get_string('dosomething', 'mod_xyz').
       $url \moodle_url The URL the user visits in order to perform this action.
       $itemcount int This represents the number of items that require action (eg. Need to write 3 forum posts). If this
           is 0 then the event is not displayed.
       $actionable bool This determines if the event is currently able to be acted on. Eg. the activity may not currently
           be open due to date restrictions so the event is shown to the user to let them know that there is an upcoming
           event but the url will not be active.
  - mod_xyz_core_calendar_event_action_shows_item_count(calendar_event $event, $itemcount = 0): This function determines
    if a given event should display the number of items to action on block_myoverview. For example, if the event type is
    ASSIGN_EVENT_TYPE_GRADINGDUE then we only display the item count if there are one or more assignments to grade. If
    you do not implement this function then the item count is always hidden. This is usually fine as the majority of
    events only have an item count of '1' (eg. Submitting an assignment) and there is no need display the item count.

=== 3.2 ===

* Callback delete_course is deprecated and should be replaced with observer for event \core\event\course_content_deleted
* update_module_button() and core_renderer::update_module_button() have been deprecated and should not be used anymore.
  Activity modules should not add the edit module button, the link is already available in the Administration block.
  Themes can choose to display the link in the buttons row consistently for all module types.
* New callback check_updates_since available. Check if the module has any update that affects the current user since the given time.
  Please refer to mod/assign/lib.php, mod/forum/lib.php or mod/quiz/lib.php for sample code.

=== 3.1 ===

* Old /mod/MODULENAME/pix/icon.gif and enrol/paypal/pix/icon.gif GIF icons have been removed. Please use pix_icon
  renderable instead.
* Callback get_types() is deprecated, instead activity modules can define callback get_shortcuts().
  See source code for get_module_metadata().

=== 3.0 ===

* Dropped support for the $module in mod/xxx/version.php files (deprecated
  since 2.7). All activity modules must use the $plugin syntax now. See
  https://docs.moodle.org/dev/version.php for details (MDL-43896).
* Modules using rating component must implement a callback mod_x_rating_can_see_item_ratings(). Refer
  to mod_forum_rating_can_see_item_ratings() for example.

=== 2.9 ===

* Added Grade to pass field to mod_form for activities that support grading.
* The method moodleform_mod::add_intro_editor() used in mod_form.php form
  definitions has been deprecated. Replace it with the new
  moodleform_mod::standard_intro_elements() method that takes the new site
  configuration requiremodintro into account (MDL-49101).

=== 2.8 ===

* Constant FEATURE_GROUPMEMBERSONLY is deprecated. Modules should remove this
  constant from their module_supports() API function.
* $CFG->enablegroupmembersonly no longer exists.

=== 2.7 ===

* modgrade form element has been redesigned and allows setting the maximum grade point higher than 100.
* The usage of $module in mod/xxx/version.php files is now deprecated. Please use
  $plugin instead. The support for the legacy notation will be dropped in Moodle 2.10.
* xxx_get_view_actions() and xxx_get_post_actions() will be ignored by new logging system for
  participation report. view_action and post_action will be detected by event's crud and edulevel.
* The functions xxx_user_outline() and xxx_user_complete() have been removed from the majority of core modules (see MDL-41286),
  except for those that require unique functionality. These functions are used by the outline report, but now if they no longer
  exist, the default behaviour is chosen, which supports the legacy and standard log storages introduced in 2.7 (see MDL-41266).
  It is highly recommended you remove these functions from your module if they are simply performing the default behaviour.

=== 2.6 ===

* Modules using the question bank MUST now declare their use of it with the xxx_supports()
  flag FEATURE_USES_QUESTIONS.
* xxx_get_types() module callback can now return subtypes that have
  a custom help text set. Also instead of array it can now return
  MOD_SUBTYPE_NO_CHILDREN. This is optional and still defaults to prior
  behavior. See get_module_metadata() in course/lib.php for details.
* shift_course_mod_dates() has been modified to accept optional mod instance id. If mod instance id is passed then
  dates changed will happen only on specific module instance and not on all instances of that module in course.

=== 2.5 ===

* support for 'mod/*' filters was removed

=== 2.4 ===

new features:

* mod/xxx/adminlib.php may now include 'plugininfo_yoursubplugintype' class definition
  used by plugin_manager; it is recommended to store extra admin settings classes in this file

optional - no changes needed:

* mod_lesson_renderer::header() now accepts an additional parameter $extrapagetitle

* mod/data/lib.php data_get_all_recordids() now has two new optional variables:  $selectdata and $params.

=== 2.3 ===

required changes in code:

* define the capability mod/xxx:addinstance (and the corresponding lang string)
  (unless your mod is a MOD_ARCHETYPE_SYSTEM).
* xxx_pluginfile() is now given the 7th parameter (hopefully the last one) that
  contains additional options for the file serving. The array should be re-passed
  to send_stored_file().

* most resourcelib_embed_* functions are replaced with core_media_renderer;
  for an example, see mod/resource/locallib.php, resource_display_embed()

optional - no changes needed:

* add support for handling course drag and drop types - functions
  xxx_dndupload_register() and xxx_dndupload_handle($uploadinfo) see:
  http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Implementing_Course_drag_and_drop_upload_support_in_a_module
